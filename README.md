# Websites

This repository contains source code for websites that I've developed. 
For now, it only contains one: 

###ResearchInfoSite 
This is a site I created during the summer of 2014, while I was doing research at Notre Dame University. It details my experiences developing an Eclipse plug-in as well as my struggles in adjusting to South Bend, Indiana. 

###movieList
This site makes choosing a movie easier on those indecisive days. Choice overload on Netflix is very real. I place movies I want to see into a mySQL database and extract them using queries written in PHP. I use Javascript AJAX and JQuery to update the page easier.
