		<p> This is an informational site for my 10-week DREU research project at Notre Dame University. Now, I don't wanna say that I was forced to do this â€¦ but I was forced to do this. It's part of my requirements for the program. But I figured if I'm going to make a website anyway, I might as well try to have fun. I hope you don't mind the informal nature of the site. If you want to check out my project, head over to the <a href="project.html">Project</a> page. If you want to find out more about me, try the <a href="Kenta">Kenta</a> page.</p>
		<p> So why "Selfies at south bend?" Well, the culture shock of coming from Brooklyn and Vassar College to South Bend and Notre Dame was pretty daunting. I thought the best way to deal with all of the new (mostly religious) stuff I was encountering was to take a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie" target="_blank">selfies</a> with them! Results have varied. Probably would not recommend. </p>
<p> Edit 8/6/14: And finally, if you want to read my final report on the project, <a href="Hasui-FinalReport.pdf" target="_blank"> here it is</a>.
<br> 
I'd like to thank the DREU program, the wonderful people at Notre Dame University, my grad student Yiji Zhang, and my mentor Professor Santelices for providing such a fantastic learning opportunity and a productive summer. Thanks everybody! </p>
