	<h2>Kenta Hasui</h2>
		<p> Kenta is a rising senior at <a href="http://www.vassar.edu" target="_blank">Vassar College</a> in Poughkeepsie, New York. He's a computer science major trying to catch up on all of his major requirements before graduation. He is also working towards an education correlate and a teaching certificate: one of his dreams is to become an elementary school teacher. 
		</p>
		<p> A lot of Kenta's free time goes playing rugby, which he has been playing since his freshman year. For people that know the positions, Kenta plays as a flanker and sometimes a <a href = "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=get%20your%20mind%20out%20of%20the%20gutter&defid=6010724" target="_blank">hooker</a>. When he's not doing that, he'sâ€¦ probably not doing much else. Maybe watching <a href= "http://www.bite.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/zoidberg-31.gif" target="_blank">Futurama</a> or <a href= "http://thewarmglow.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/8.gif?w=551" target="_blank">Parks and Rec</a>. Or napping. Napping is cool.  
		</p>
		<p> If you want to get in contact with Kenta, please email <a href="mailto:kehasui@vassar.edu">kehasui@vassar.edu</a>! Or if he graduates and Vassar heartlessly tears his student email away from him, try <a href="mailto:khasui720@gmail.com">khasui720@gmail.com</a>.
