		<h2>About My Mentors</h2>
		<p> Everybody in this lab is so sweet. The two grad students that I work with are Haipeng Cai and Yiji Zhang. Haipeng has been nothing but wonderful to me since day one. I can always count on him to greet me with a smile when I see him. And Yiji has been my guardian angel here! On my first day, she picked me up from the airport, helped me find my dorm, and showed me where I could find something to eat. She gives me all of my tasks and handles the many questions I ask her. Haipeng and Yiji are both super hard working and wonderful people.</p>
		<p> The professor that I work for is Professor Raul Santelices. He's from Santiago, Chile! Pretty exotic. He's worked as a software engineer and videogame/education technology architect. Now, he works as an Assistant Professor in Notre Dame's Department of Computer Science and Engineering. His primary area of research is in Software Engineering and Software Quality. According to his website (which you can access below), his "mission is to help shape the art and science of software construction in ways that maximize productivity and reliability." And as accomplished as he is, Professor Santelices is still a very kind and understanding man.</p>
